About me
======
I’m a senior majoring in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Future Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology([HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn)). In September 2025, I will begin my master’s studies at the [EPCC Lab](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, fortunately advised by [Prof. Shixuan Sun](https://shixuansun.github.io/).
